It is that powerful potential to continue to support the 2,40,000+ rural families who benefit from  our carbon offset programs. To do all we can to harness tech for good. To energize platforms to  nurture inclusion and belonging among our diverse employees, facilitate employee wellness and  experience. With 1,35,355 women making 39.4% of the workforce, we are making steady progress  toward our goal of 45% women in the organization by 2030. We launched an exclusive learning  channel for our suppliers too, this year. It drives ESG learning and best practices while providing  learners an opportunity to discuss, ideate and engage on ESG topics. It’s part of our overall effort  to build responsible supply chains. It’s the opportunity for us to amplify human potential and  create the next opportunity for people, businesses and communities. Ethisphere Institute, the global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business  practices, recognized our efforts, for the third year in a row, listing us as one of the world’s most  ethical companies. For us, however, the true reward of our efforts, continues to be the measurable impact we make on  the ecosystem - building opportunities for everyone to thrive and grow responsibly. Because, at Infosys, ESG is indeed an opportunity.

Climate change  Human activity has been increasingly driving  the rise in global temperature, which has  reached approximately 1.1° C above pre- industrial levels. This has led to rapid and  widespread impact on global climate systems.  The year 2022 was marked by record droughts,  heat waves, forest fires, floods, and a record low  level of the Antarctic Sea ice, crippling human  population across the world. Despite the Paris  Agreement of 2015 reaching a milestone in  cooperation among various countries to adopt  strong measures for limiting global warming to  1.5°C, the pace or scale of action has not been  adequate to achieve the stated goals. As a step  Environment Infosys Nagpur campus to mitigate the impacts of climate change,  nations have adopted the Glasgow Climate  Pact in 2021 with a goal to transform the 2020s  into a decade of climate action and support.  The World Economic Forum’s 2023 Global  Risks Report focuses on the various sectors  where the world is at a crucial juncture, calling  for action to get ready for possible future  catastrophes, while on the other hand, striving  to build resilience. The signatories to the Paris  Agreement, including India, have put forward  their commitments to reduce Greenhouse Gas  (GHG) emissions in the form of INDCs (Intended  Nationally Determined Contributions) based on  their capabilities, circumstances and priorities. At Infosys, climate change considerations  continue to play a key role in all strategies:  from mergers and acquisitions to leasing new  offices and engagement with our stakeholders.  While continuing to remain carbon neutral,  Infosys also integrates strong efforts to better  our sustainability performance by consistently  embracing clean technology in our operations  and client solutions, thereby minimizing the  impact on the environment.

Keeping this growing demand in mind, Infosys  has been a pioneer in building sustainable  campuses. From creating lush green campuses  to implementing innovative technologies  like radiant cooling, Infosys has deployed  one of the largest enterprise-level energy  conservation programs globally and achieved  significant reduction in resource intensity over  the past 15 years.  Our buildings are the primary consumers of  energy. We are committed to building our  new infrastructure in a sustainable manner  and pursuing energy efficiency projects  in existing infrastructure. We will continue  to implement innovative technologies in  buildings and collaborate with experts and  academia to ensure our infrastructure is  greener and smarter. The focus areas for energy  efficiency measures in green buildings and  existing buildings continue to be lighting,  air-conditioning, automation, UPS, building  façade, data centers, and server rooms.  In this process, we have not only achieved  some of the global best standards in  green buildings, but we have also set new  benchmarks in green building certification.

This information is used  to make a comparative analysis of alternative  materials and construction technologies that  can help reduce overall environmental impact. The LCA can be used for the following  purposes: 1. Identify potential for improvement of  environmental performance.  2. Comparison of environmental performance  using alternative materials.  3. Documentation of environmental  performance for certification, labelling and  marketing. 4. Drive our climate action agenda across our  supply chain. Infosys Kolkata's LCA-based approach has set  an example for the rest of the corporates.  Renewable energy Greening the energy mix To enhance its efforts towards meeting the  environmental goal of carbon neutrality,  Infosys has adopted the use of renewable  energy in its power mix. Infosys has set up solar  PV panels on the rooftops of office buildings.   In total, Infosys has 14.4 MW of rooftop and  ground mount solar PV panels. Further Infosys  has set up a 40 MW captive solar power plant  at Sira, Karnataka. In total, Infosys has 60 MW of  total installed solar capacity.  Infosys also procures green energy through  third-party power purchase agreements.  Through these measures, Infosys has 57.9%  Climate change Environment By collecting and reporting data metrics,  companies can better understand the impact  of their operations on the environment, society,  and governance.

The Command Center in Infosys Bangalore share of renewable energy in its power mix for  India operations.  Infosys Hyderabad and Bhubaneshwar are  utilizing renewable energy from the recently- launched green tariff mechanism for   Commercial and Industrial (C&I) consumers. Infosys collects data continuously through its  command centers. This command center allows  us to schedule ‘auto-pilot operations’ using a  built-in intelligence system. This has enabled  us to monitor over 35 mn sq. ft. of office space.  Analyzing this granular data, Infosys has made  informed decisions in new building design and  improved operational efficiencies.

The Company  took up active measures to reduce and  streamline the energy demand in its campuses.  This demand-focused approach helped in  reducing carbon emissions to a great extent.  Infosys has also invested in renewable energy  (solar PV) plants to avoid emissions. However,  there are unavoidable emissions due to  business travel, employee commute etc., that  had to be offset to achieve carbon neutrality.  Infosys’ carbon offset program has carefully  selected grassroots social development  projects, implemented them at scale to  Since 2016, we have implemented eight  efficient cookstove projects, four biogas, one  each of rural electrification and integrated  community-based projects (solar, cookstove,  street lighting and public health center) across  India.  Carbon neutral events Infosys organizes a few public events  through the year. In 2023, Infosys  envisioned to make these events a  hallmark of sustainability. Environment- friendly measures, like the use of  sustainable construction materials,  water conservation measures and zero  plastic use, emphasized Infosys’ holistic  approach to sustainability. Detailed  carbon emissions were calculated for the  travel of the participants to the event.  These were then compensated by Infosys’  carbon credits. This effort made all the  major events organized by Infosys in 2023  carbon neutral with minimum impact on  the environment. 2,40,000+ rural families continue to benefit  from our carbon offset programs generate emission offsets. While this approach  requires careful long-term planning, intense  due diligence, and strict management control,  it is significantly more rewarding. Infosys partnered with local NGOs to undertake  projects in rural India that would benefit  society. These projects include improved  cookstoves and household biogas plants,  which improved rural livelihoods, community  health and social harmony. Improved indoor  air quality and diversified income have ensured  a better standard of living for women and  children.

According to an estimate of the carrying  capacity of our planet, it takes the Earth  18 months to restore what is used in just  12 months. Every year, the world produces  2.01 billion tons of municipal solid waste,  of which, at least 33% is not handled in an  environmentally responsible way.  Today, waste management is a crucial  challenge globally. Waste management  includes the collection, segregation, and  disposal of waste. Waste collection is a critical  step in managing waste. Segregation of waste  at source helps in quick disposal and has  monetary advantages like extracting energy  from the methane generated by decomposing  waste. Solid waste management operations are  typically a local responsibility, and nearly 70%  of countries have established institutions with  the responsibility for policy development and  regulatory oversight in the waste sector.  Infosys’ waste management approach is based  on the philosophy of Reduce, Reuse, Refurbish,  Repurpose and Recycle. We seek to uphold  our ambition of zero waste to landfills through  active minimization combined with technology  investment in recycling and streamlining  systems and processes. With our efforts, we  contribute to a circular economy and convert  waste into resources. Infosys has established  robust waste management practices, focusing  on waste collection, segregation and disposal  of waste.  Segregation at source Waste segregation at source refers to the  process of identifying and segregating various  types of solid wastes at the place or location  of their generation. We segregate waste  mainly into two categories - hazardous and  non-hazardous waste. Separate storage of  various components of solid waste such as  biodegradable wastes including landscape  / garden waste and food waste and non- biodegradable wastes including sanitary  waste and non-recyclable inert waste, various  categories of e-waste, and construction and  demolition wastes is practiced. A color code for  bins has been implemented for different types  of waste.  The Infosys waste management practice  involves segregation of waste at source,  secondary segregation, efficient collection  and handling, recycling, and effective disposal  of all wastes while adhering to applicable  legislations. This enables reduction of negative  environmental impacts. We also insist on eco- friendly packaging for all our purchases.

Waste generated at source gets  segregated and evaluated for reuse if possible. Waste like wood, STP sludge and bio manure slurry  from bio-methanation plants gets reused inside the campus. Construction and demolition waste  is sent to government authorized landfill sites where it further gets reused for various purposes  by the municipal corporation. Used oil from kitchens is utilized in biogas plants as it has high  codigestion COD (chemical oxygen demand) levels, which in turn generates increased biogas.

As on date, our biogas plants have a capacity  to treat 10 tons of waste a day. The bio- methanation plants/ bioreactors in Infosys  are high-rate digesters where the organic  loading rate is significantly higher even when  its loaded close to its rated capacity. Bi-phasic  bio-digestion, known for its effectiveness,  was tested at one of the Infosys sites. This  testing helped overcome challenges, such  as inconsistent input feed rate as well as the  quality of wet waste. The trial was a great  success as we were able to establish process  stabilization at all our bio-methanation plants  across India. Waste Environment   Waste recovery options Recycling Waste such as paper, plastic and metal, are  recycled, converted into other usable forms  and circulated back to the supply chain.  We have established biogas plants in our  campuses where food waste and landscape  waste is treated through bio-methanation  process, which produces biogas an alternative  to LPG in our food courts. We also have sludge  drying beds located next to our biogas plants  to dry the slurry. Soon after sun drying, dried  manure can be used for landscaping.

Co-processing achieves a superior  environmental performance as compared  to landfill and incineration which can  be demonstrated through life-cycle  assessment of waste. Co-processing  is also recognized by the UNEP Basel  Convention as a practical, cost-efficient,  safe and environmentally-preferred  option compared to other waste  treatment options. Co-processing Co-processing is the use of waste as raw  material, or as a source of energy, or both to  replace natural mineral resources and fossil  fuels. Generally, waste which cannot be reused  or recycled and has high calorific value is  selected for co-processing.  At Infosys, waste such as tetra packs, tea bags,  rubber waste, paper packaging, low value  plastic, plastic gunny bags, thermacol, foam,  carpets, discarded mop refills, lanyards, ceramic  waste, flex banners, artificial grass mats, floor  mats, glass waste, cloth waste etc., are sent for  co-processing. Environment Waste vendor evaluation  At Infosys, our green procurement policy  ensures rigorous vendor evaluation. Waste  vendors undergo a detailed vendor site audit  against several regulatory requirements.  Post this, commercial proposals are invited  and scrutinized to ensure they comply  with requirements. The proposals are then  shared with the commercial team for further  negotiations, if any. Once this process is  completed, a formal agreement is entered into  with the vendors. Vendors are audited annually  based on the waste vendor checklist.  E-waste management At Infosys, we have been persistent in our  efforts to ensure that we reduce, reuse, recycle  and dispose e-waste responsibly. Our e-waste  includes computers, desktops, laptops,  keyboards, mobiles, printers, cartridges and  batteries. Generated e-waste is always sent  back to original manufacturers (under buyback  schemes) or authorized recyclers who provide  us certificates on the successful recycling  and recovery of the material. The selection  of authorized recyclers is done keeping in  mind the extent of resource circularity in  their process. E-waste is regulated through  legislation and hence we evaluate the vendor  to ensure all compliances are addressed prior  to disposal. Environmental compliance We have a strong environmental management  system aligned with ISO 14001:2015 standards  across all India locations in line with our HSE  strategy and covers a significant portion of  the employees across the organization.  The  management system is implemented across  locations globally based on applicable legal  requirements and internal benchmarks and are  a part of our internal audit coverage.   We ensure adherence to the applicable legal  requirements across our locations.

Waste disposal options As per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)  and State Pollution Control Board (SPCB)  guidelines, bio medical waste, oil-soaked  cotton, oil filters from DG sets, and other wastes  are disposed of through authorized agencies.  These agencies incinerate the waste as per  prescribed guidelines. The resultant ash is sent  to Treatment, Storage, Disposal Facility (TSDF)  landfills for safe disposal and in a few locations,  it is diverted for cement manufacturing.

Through this  partnership, Infosys will contribute towards   ID-led transformation efforts on a national  scale. Income tax The Integrated E-Filing and Central Processing  Center program takes the tax automation  journey, which started 10 year ago, to the next  level. The program not only integrates filing  and processing into a single platform, it also  brings innovation to each of the layers. In filing,  the focus was on simplification and scale. With  innovative features like tax wizard, mobile  application and pre-fill of tax forms, the new  portal makes it easier and more convenient  for taxpayers to file their income tax returns  and access related services. In processing the  entire engine was redesigned with modern  technology tools and patterns resulting in  dramatic reduction in wait time for release of  refunds (from 79 days to 7 days). Goods and Services Tax  Network (GSTN) Infosys partnered with the GSTN to  implement and manage the indirect taxation  platform for GST in India. The platform was  designed to assist taxpayers in preparing,  filing returns, making payments of indirect  tax liabilities, and maintaining additional  compliances. This unique and complex IT  project established a uniform interface for  taxpayers under indirect taxes, which was  achieved through a common and shared IT  infrastructure between the central and state  governments. This has significantly simplified  the tax compliance process for taxpayers, by  reducing the burden of maintaining separate  systems and complying with varying state- level tax regulations, and has made it easier  for taxpayers to maintain their tax records  accurately. ~1.6 lakh  with around   90 lakh enquiries registered  users Impact: ~100mn registered users Impact: Tech for good Social Impact: ~14mntaxpayers  supported and serviced by the  GSTN platform so far Performance on social goals Enabling digital talent at scale Tech for good Diversity, equity and inclusion Energizing local communities Employee wellness and experience ESG is an opportunity ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE \n",

We used our Live Enterprise suite of technologies for  this. Some of our offerings that deliver employee experience are listed below: Creating employee experience  through digital transformation  We are committed to creating a world-class  experience for our employees. We believe this  will inspire employees to deliver their best  for our clients. As our employees develop a  digital future for our clients, we want them to  experience the same in their day-to-day work  at Infosys. Hence, the digitization of human  resources processes and practices becomes  a critical lever to create a great workplace  experience. Transforming the employee experience at scale  in a company of more than 3,43,000 people  spread across 56 countries is only possible  through technology. For us, digitization was  the only way forward. We are reimagining  experience using a combination of process  busting, automation and digital transformation  in people practices to create consumer-grade  digital experience for our employees. Through  digitization, we are simplifying our processes,  eliminating unnecessary approval steps  and leading straight through processing.  An example of this is InfyMe, our mobile- first, self-service platform that brings all  services to our employees’ fingertips anytime,  anywhere. InfyMe is designed to be intuitive  and contextual and aids networking and  collaboration. We continued to enrich our  InfyMe app with more services that enable  teams to operate, connect and collaborate  easily and it is particularly effective in the  hybrid work model. More than 200 touchpoints  for activities have been merged into the  intuitive interface of InfyMe. We are making our performance appraisal  process light, easy and convenient. As a first  step, we have introduced a senior management  review interface on InfyMe. Through this, we  are enabling an enhanced user experience,  faster navigation, seamless data integration  and a unified experience around development,  performance and careers. We are leveraging  the power of the Live Enterprise platform  to enable timely nudges around actions,  performance and development.    We are also focused on automation of backend,  administrative activities that can free up  HR personnel and enable them to focus on  enhancing employee experience and forming  strategic partnerships with business. An  example of this is Launchpad, our onboarding  platform, which has enabled us to digitize our  onboarding process. This mobile-based app  provides a guided flow that helps new hires  initiate their onboarding process, complete  all the necessary documentation and data  updates before their date of joining. With all  operational processes taken care of prior to  joining, employees are engaged in a more  meaningful way with managers, teams and HR  from Day 1.  In addition to the above, we are making our  systems smarter with:  • Nudges to managers and employees to  drive the right behavior on closures and  guide managers to take the right decisions  in matters like role change, retention, etc.  • Chatbots that provide instant resolutions to  queries and transactions  • Omni-channel experience for employees to  get on call support using a conversational  IVR that uses natural language voice inputs  from callers to direct them to the right  agents for support  • Self-service portals  • Robotic process automations in people  processes to reduce manual work Performance on social goals Enabling digital talent at scale Tech for good Diversity, equity and inclusion Energizing local communities Employee wellness and experience ESG is an opportunity ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE \n",

A ranking  is done based on the severity and probability  of the risk. The Occupational Health and  Safety (OH&S) hazards in the workplace are  communicated to all concerned stakeholders  who are also consulted when there are  changes in operations. Relevant OH&S hazards  are identified, and appropriate operational  controls are implemented. During training,  the hazards are shared along with directions  on ways to reduce the risk. Employees are also  consulted during development and review  of policies and procedures to manage risks.  Emergency response procedures for different  scenarios are established and mock drills are  conducted to evaluate our preparedness,  response and learnings.  Employee wellness and experience Social Occupational Health and Safety Safety and well-being at the workplace is  an important consideration in a responsible  business and Infosys accords the highest  priority to this aspect. The Health, Safety and  Environmental (HSE) Management System  at Infosys termed ‘Ozone’ is driven by the  Management commitment, legal requirements  and expectations of our stakeholders. Ozone  has not only enabled us to obtain assurance on  Management System  The robust management system has enabled  us achieve certification to ISO 45001:2018  and ISO 14001:2015 standards across all India  locations, including Infosys Limited and its  subsidiaries, in line with our HSE strategy. The  management system is implemented across  locations globally based on applicable legal  requirements and internal benchmarks and  are a part of our internal audit coverage. At  the helm of our Health, Safety, Environment  Management System (HSEMS) is our Executive  Vice President-Finance and Chief Risk  a. Risk management Ozone is based on the Demings cycle  and has a focused risk-based approach in  ensuring identification and implementation  of operational controls in line with hierarchy  and effective mitigation of hazards. Risk  assessment is proactively conducted to  identify hazards for all existing / new /  modified activities, processes, products or  services and the implementation of measures  to minimize or control impacts and monitor  them in a structured manner. Risk assessment  is proactively conducted on a yearly basis  or at the beginning of a new process or  activity. Reactive risk assessments are also  carried out at least once every quarter based  on incidents that have occurred during the  period. Hazardous conditions present are  identified and prioritized for elimination  and control. Once the identified hierarchy of  the processes instituted through certifications  but has also fostered a culture of safety and  well-being across the organization. We ensure  adherence to all applicable regulations in all  the regions we operate across the globe. We  consciously strive to ensure zero accidents,  physical and emotional well-being, and safety  of our stakeholders. Officer. The effectiveness and adequacy of  the HSE framework, its execution and HSE  performance are evaluated through periodic  management reviews. The internal-external  issues and opportunities for the organizational  context are identified. Interested parties  (including all our stakeholders), their  needs and expectations, our expectations,  legal requirements, owners and mode of  communication are also documented. Some of  the elements of the management system are  listed below: b. Incident management Incidents which include near misses / potential  hazards / accidents are reported through  internal applications, supervisors, or mails. Root  causes of incidents are identified, analyzed  and appropriate corrective actions are taken  to avoid recurrence or occurrence of incidents  leading to injuries / losses. c. Occupational Health and Safety  (OH&S) Committees OH&S Committees comprising cross-functional  teams are established at each of our campuses  and offices. The Development Center Heads  chair the safety committee meetings at their  respective locations in India. In our overseas  offices, these committees are formed based  on the local legislations. The representation  of employees in safety committees is 100%.  The committee ensures the establishment,  implementation, maintenance, and continual  improvement of processes needed for the  elimination of hazards and minimization of  risks. Contract workers are also an intrinsic part  of the committee, which is one of the ways to  ensure participation and consultation.

Training and awareness  Embedding HSE culture in the organization  necessitates competency development.  Training needs are identified based on  the nature of jobs, which may have a  significant impact on the environment or  may pose occupational health and safety  risks. Training includes awareness building,  mock drills, classroom sessions and periodic  demonstrations. HSEMS training is also a part  of our employee induction program. To enable  continuous learning, a HSE awareness module  is available on Lex, our internal learning  platform. Job-specific and generic trainings  are conducted for contractual staff during  induction and later through refresher training.  e. Health and safety interventions  We have always focused on building a culture  of safety at Infosys. Individual responsibility  for safety is always emphasized. Safety in the  workplace is one of the highest priorities.  Systems have been established to ensure the  same, including work permits, trainings, Lock  out, Tag out (LOTO), safety inspections, audits,  operational controls and monitoring. Policies  and processes, which cover various aspects of  safety, have been established. These include  women’s safety, lone working, transport,  travel and construction, among others. Gaps,  learnings, deviations and findings, if any, are  identified, controls implemented and tracked  for effective closure. As Infosys is an IT / ITES  company, there are no product risks but there  are risks including those related to provision of  services like ergonomics, emotional well-being,  risks associated with operation of utilities,  commute. We have established numerous  initiatives, interventions, virtual sessions, and  process controls to address them. Awareness  sessions are conducted for ergonomics across  locations. Workstations and furniture are  designed and procured after considering their  ergonomic advantages. We have also taken  care to procure systems which have inbuilt  features that help avoid glare and hence  reduce such instances. Sessions on ergonomics  help address work-related conditions such as  myalgia. Ergonomic incidents reported are  treated and exercise regimens suggested.  During fiscal 2023, 39 occupational ergonomics  issues were reported. Various interventions on physical and  emotional well-being were enabled under  the aegis of our HALE / SAFE initiatives during  the year. Well-equipped occupational health  centers / physiotherapy facilities are available  on our campuses in India. The telemedicine  portal through which employees can consult  our occupational health center doctors online  was operational in India during the year.  Behavior-Based Safety (BBS) programs include  BBS observation for contract staff, periodic  inspections, trainings, observations from mock  drills and employee engagement programs.  f. Participation and consultation  The process includes:  • Employee consultation in development  and review of policies and procedures to  manage risks  • Consultation where there are any changes  that affect workplace health and safety;  a management of change procedure is in  place to address health and safety issues  before a change occurs  • Representation of employees in health  and safety matters; the Safety Committee  includes employee and contract workmen  representatives  • The OH&S hazards in the workplace are  communicated to all concerned including  contractors and visitors. They are also  consulted when there are changes in  operations and the relevant OH&S hazards  are identified, appropriate operational  controls implemented and the same is  communicated to all concerned • Health promotion programs are conducted  to encourage employee involvement in  health and safety. A Safety Week and Health  Week are conducted annually. • Employees, including contract workmen,  are entrusted with the responsibility of  participation in the ongoing HSE activities.  Employees are encouraged to participate  in the process of reviewing risks in their  respective areas of operations from time to  time, and developing and sharing strategies  to eliminate, mitigate or reduce those risks.  • Employees are required to report all  incidents to the HSE team to establish  and implement operational controls to  avoid the recurrence of the incidents and  aid in elimination of unsafe behavior and  conditions. • The expectation from employees is to  participate in the emergency mock drills  and report or identify learnings which need  to be addressed.

The sense  of connectedness measured at 91% because  of the ability of different teams to collaborate  and connect with each other emotionally.  HALE successfully touched the lives of 1,50,000  employees through 431 initiatives, where we  witnessed a three-fold increase in employee  participation. The key focus for us was mental  health. We conducted 150 interventions on  mental health-related topic this year.  Hybrid well-being The hybrid work model urged us to consider a  hybrid well-being awareness and engagement  approach. We created a page on hybrid  well-being on our HALE portal and launched  a hybrid wellness toolkit for employees and  managers, and a Hello Hybrid widget which  provided HALE counsellor contacts. Initiatives  across development centers such as habit- forming campaigns, Bring Your Kids to Work  days and story-sharing forums strengthened  awareness and engagement among  employees.  Employee satisfaction  Infosys has robust mechanisms to gauge  employee sentiments and feedback. Up  until fiscal 2020, employee engagement at  Infosys was measured through the annual  LITMUS survey. When the pandemic struck,  the team quickly reimagined this tool for  the new remote way of work and introduced  a periodic feedback mechanism called  Pulse. Pulse collects ongoing and real-time  feedback from employees anonymously on  key organization-wide themes that shape  an employee’s experience at Infosys such as  work, learning and careers. We poll the entire  organization through a micro survey every  month. In addition to this, we also poll our  employees on select tenure-based milestones  and specific events including onboarding,  job rotation and appraisals. This cumulative  understanding of employee perception, and  feedback from actual events and milestones  have strengthened our sensing architecture  to obtain richer insights of employee  experiences. To drive change across the  Employee satisfaction FY2021 FY2022 73% 75% FY2023 82% Performance management  Infosys has established a high-performance  culture and our employee breathe this each  day. Our performance management process  drives a 'meritocracy culture' yet stays  individual employee focused and development  oriented. We focus on identifying the best  performers against standards of performance  instead of relative comparison of individuals.  This mechanism helps us to identify our best  performers through well-defined goals that  are always relevant, continuous feedback and  a strong focus on employee development.  Aligning with this performance management  philosophy, we have the defined performance  review and assessment process.  Continuous feedback is an essential  element of the process with regular reviews,  culminating into a rating based holistic view  of the employee’s performance. Performance  conversations between employee and manager  happens on an ongoing basis, given the  continuous performance process that we have  in Infosys. The continuous feedback process  organization, all managers have access to a  real-time customized dashboard with feedback  from their respective teams, which enable  them to engage with their teams better and  address any concerns. This dashboard has  multiple views and advanced analytics such  as heatmaps, trendlines, sentiment analytics  to enable the managers to prioritize focus  areas according to their teams. Managers  along with their respective units HR executives  and leadership work on making changes or  improvements at the Unit / team level on the  ground. Over 50,000 employees participated  in Q4 with insights gathered around various  themes of the organization. These insights  have led us to create focus areas for actionizing  on a quarterly basis which is socialized with the  leadership team.

Thus, iCount goes a long way in providing  a holistic view of the employees performance.  Resolution hubs  A safe and positive work environment is what  we want to be associated with. In keeping with  this philosophy, we envisage an open-door  policy. Employees can access several forums  where they can highlight matters or concerns  faced at the workplace. This is achieved  through a well-established and robust  grievance resolution mechanism comprising  ‘resolution hubs’. The Anti-Sexual Harassment  Initiative (ASHI) and the Hearing Employees  and Resolving (HEAR) forums are designated  as redressal forums for sexual harassment and  workplace related complaints, respectively.  Resolution hubs adhere to the principles of  natural justice, ensure confidentiality, and  non-retaliation while addressing concerns. The  concerns are handled with utmost sensitivity  and are redressed and closed in a timebound  manner. A detailed investigation process  ensures fairness and provides an opportunity  to present facts and any material evidence  pertaining to the grievance.  Read more on Infosys resolution hub  Human rights  Infosys is a signatory to the UNGC. Our  human rights stand is contained in our Code  of Conduct and Ethics in an important tenet,  ‘Respecting Each Other.’ The Infosys Human  Rights Statement articulates our philosophy to  provide a discrimination-free workplace for all  employees and contractors. All our employees  and contractors undergo a mandatory Smart  Awareness Quiz (SAQ), every year, which  includes questions on human rights and the  Infosys Code of Conduct and Ethics. The SAQ is  a comprehensive tool which also includes ‘self- study’ tutorials, allowing employees to learn  and then take up the assessments.  In fiscal 2023, we conducted an independent  Human Rights Impact Assessment of our  operations across India. India comprises >80%  of our employee base. The assessment protocol  was created based on the Articles contained  in the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights (UDHR), ILO, UNGC Principles, the GRI  Standards, the Business Responsibility and  Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) parameters,  as well as Health and Safety criteria and  environment management systems.   It is our constant endeavor to make Infosys a  place where people can be the best version  of themselves. The Talent Pulse Report 2022,  provides a glimpse into our Employee wellness  and experience practices. Employee wellness  and experience is an important ambition  as a part of Infosys’ ESG Vision 2030. The  suggestions from the independent human  rights impact assessment allowed us to  accelerate our part time and remote work  policies and inform our hybrid model further.  The minimum notice period for significant  operational changes are included in the  collective bargaining agreements (CBA)  wherever mandated by law. In countries  where there is no such mandate to include  them in the CBA or in countries where CBA  is not mandated, we abide by the local laws  prevailing in the land. In all other scenarios,  Infosys prescribes the notice period based on  the type of change. All our security personnel are trained on  human rights related topics. The Infosys  Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) has reference  to human rights and it states, ‘Infosys expects  its suppliers to support and respect the  protection of internationally proclaimed  human rights and to ensure that they are not  complicit in human rights abuses.’ As part  of the onboarding process the vendors  have to accept the SCoC. The procurement  team ensures that SCoC acceptance is done  by vendors and maintains a tracker for the  same. In fiscal 2022, we committed to an  independent responsible supplier assessment  for our top 100 suppliers over the next 4 years.  As on fiscal 2023, 46 supplier ESG assessments  have been completed.  Read more. helps managers provide instant feedback for  necessary improvements in the work that is  being done.  Infosys performance management puts  equal focus on the future development of the  employee and the introduction of Individual  Development Plan (IDP) is a testament to the  same. IDPs are created by employees under  the guidance of the manager and are a perfect  blend of theory and application. Managers  coach and mentor the employee to set career  and professional aspirations and reach them  in a structured manner. Employees are also  encouraged to take up training to upskill /  reskill themselves to meet the needs of the  projects.  In case of continued lack of expected  performance, employees are identified for a  structured performance improvement plan  where they are given goals and the managers  support them in achieving these goals.  At the end of the performance cycle employees  receive a performance rating. To support the  process, we have our web and mobile app  called iCount, where employees can add their  goals and are encouraged to update progress  against the same on a regular basis. Managers  can provide feedback to employees on these  goals and support them in achieving the  objectives. Feedback from client stakeholder  (although not mandated by the process) is  also a key input that the manager uses during  performance and development conversations.

The  portal contains ESG learning and best practices  and provides learners an opportunity to  discuss, ideate and engage on ESG topics. Corporate governance Governance ESG assessments  In 2021, we made a commitment to assess  100 of our top suppliers (by spend) on ESG  over a four-year period. As on fiscal 2023,  we have covered 46 suppliers through  this assessment. The assessments covered  governance, ethics and compliance with  law, fair business practices, labor practices  and human rights, health and safety, and  environment. The assessment is based on a  protocol which leverages the Infosys Supplier  Code of Conduct (SCoC), ISO 26000, GRI,  UNHRC, Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) and  other international frameworks. The Infosys  Supplier Code of Conduct leverages the UNGC  principles including protecting and upholding  internationally proclaimed human rights,  endorsing treating all persons with respect  and dignity while safeguarding their rights, the  elimination of forced and compulsory labor,  the abolition of child labor in the supply chain  and strong corporate governance practices  including anti-corruption and anti-bribery and  promoting fair business practices across the  supply chain. As an environmentally conscious  organization, Infosys also urges suppliers to  protect the environment and make abstemious  use of scarce natural resources in their  business processes. As part of the onboarding  process, all vendors have to accept the Infosys  SCoC, and this is ensured and tracked by the  procurement team.  46%  of top 100 suppliers  underwent ESG assessments  in the last two years No. of MSME  suppliers  24,891 contract staff  engaged 777 Our centralized procurements are in India,  but we engage with local suppliers for local  needs across geographies. The proportion  of spending on local suppliers (in India) was  nearly 66% in fiscal 2023. We did not have  any significant actual and potential negative  environmental and social impacts in the supply  chain. We did not have any significant changes  to our supply chain in fiscal 2023.

      "ESG REPORT 2022-23  54 Infosys | ESG REPORT 2022-23 External Document © 2023 Infosys Limited The Ethics and Compliance Program at Infosys has two key objectives – to uphold and ensure the  values of integrity and transparency and to assure enterprise-wide regulatory compliance. Integrity is key to nurturing a responsible business. Beyond regulation and stakeholder  attention, there is a growing recognition that good behavior is good for business. At Infosys, our  commitment to a value-based ethos is enshrined in our Code of Conduct and Ethics. Our values are the principles we use to run the Company daily and are the source of our Code of  Conduct and Ethics. Our values are the foundation of everything we do and are encapsulated in  the acronym C-LIFE (Client value; Leadership by example; Integrity and transparency; Fairness and  Excellence). Reinforcing a culture of  compliance  1. Code of Conduct and Ethics (Digital  version): We also have a digital version of  the Code of Conduct and Ethics. It provides  user-friendly access to specific topics  in an interactive manner. It is a unique  audio-visual experience and is easy to  navigate. The Code can be accessed on  mobile devices as well. The digital version  of the Code aims to help every employee  understand the behavior we expect and  the principles and values we uphold.  We aim to continue to build a culture of  compliance, where everyone feels they are  able to do the right thing and prioritize  legal and ethical choices. The digital version  of the Code is available here. 2. Code of Conduct and Ethics training:  Our employees and Board members  are trained on the Code of Conduct and  Ethics. We have a Smart Awareness Quiz  (SAQ) which includes training modules  that employees are mandatorily required  to undertake every year to renew their  commitment to the Code of Conduct and  Ethics. Our vendor partners were also  trained on the Supplier Code of Conduct  through various channels including  live sessions during the vendor partner  meet called Sambandh. We also have  a detailed communication plan to use  multiple channels of communication like  emails, video messages, blogs, gamified  assessments, and storyboards to spread  awareness about various policies. 3. #SwipeRightforIntegrity:  #SwipeRightforIntegrity is an annual  legal and compliance event organized  by Infosys. The event brings our leaders  together to reinforce our values of integrity,  Integrity and compliance  transparency and good governance to  build enduring relationships with our  clients, employees and partners. It has  become a platform to create awareness  and have an engaging dialogue with all  stakeholders, and influence behavior and  showcase the Infosys culture. This has  taken forward the compliance and ethics  program and created increased awareness  of expected behavior. 4. Local Compliance Officer program:   To further raise awareness among our  employees about ethical aspects globally, a  local compliance officer (LCO) network has  also been created across the Infosys Group  in collaboration with Office of Integrity  and Compliance. The LCO network plays a  crucial role, in promoting an organizational  culture that encourages ethical conduct  and a commitment to compliance with the  law, regulations, and policies and helps in  maximizing the impact of ethics-related  communication and training. Corporate governance Governance Code of Conduct and Ethics  We firmly believe that following the highest  standards of business conduct and ethics helps  us run our business responsibly. Our Code  of Conduct and Ethics helps us maintain the  highest ethical standards for our employees. It complies with the legal requirements of  applicable laws and regulations, including  anti-bribery and anti-corruption and ethical  handling of conflicts of interest. It also  highlights expectations from our employees.  The Code of Conduct and Ethics is signed off  by the Board and the Office of Integrity and  Compliance is the custodian of the Code of  Conduct and Ethics. Our business partners  acknowledge and comply with the Supplier  Code of Conduct which is based on the UNGC  principles. Purpose statement Our Code of Conduct and Ethics now  encapsulates our purpose statement:   “To amplify human potential and create the  next opportunity for people, businesses and  communities.” Recognition as   one of the world’s   most ethical companies Infosys has been recognized as one  of the 2023 World’s Most Ethical  Companies for the third consecutive  year by Ethisphere, a global leader in  defining and advancing the standards  of ethical business.

The export  control program protects the company and  its employees from potential risk of violation  of sanctions prescribed under export control  regulations and facilitates business expansion  in accordance with these regulations. All our  customers and vendors are screened against  various sanctions to ensure that we are  compliant. As part of the program, training  modules are rolled out to relevant employees  to ensure that they are aware and are  compliant with export control laws.  We have a self-assessment and certification  program in place for anti-bribery and anti- corruption, anti-trust / anti-competition, and  export control.  Whistleblower Policy The Infosys Whistleblower Policy, last amended  in January 2022, is a comprehensive and  well-designed mechanism that encourages  employees, vendors, customers, and any other  stakeholders to report any unethical conduct,  violation of applicable laws or the Company’s  Code of Conduct and Ethics occurring within  the Company. With strict confidentiality  measures and multiple reporting channels,  the policy ensures that whistleblowers are  protected from any retaliation. The company  reviews all complaints impartially and takes  appropriate action, as applicable, while  providing regular communication to ensure  awareness about the policy. The Infosys  Whistleblower Policy is a testament to the  Company’s commitment to transparency,  accountability, and responsible corporate  citizenship. Corporate governance Governance Use of technology for effective  compliance monitoring of  controls We have leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI)  and Machine Learning (ML) technology to  review and identify exceptions in compliance  and ABAC controls. Compliance proof-testing • Infosys implemented a compliance program  covering 80 countries and 14 regulatory  areas across major business enabling  functions in September 2018. • The program instituted a self-assessment of  the compliance status against a compliance  framework with a maker checker process  built into it. • The program also enabled the creation of  a repository of compliance proofs against  self-assessment. • By consolidating compliance proofs across  countries and regulatory areas, Infosys  designed an OCR-based technology to  scan the proofs and validate if the proofs  corroborate the compliance status. • The OCR technology was combined with  a rule engine to test compliance controls  around timeliness and accuracy of the  compliance proof. ABAC program • Infosys develops and manages multiple  office facilities and collaborates with  multiple vendors / service providers during  the various phases of construction. Infosys  engages with vendors for infrastructure  development and facility maintenance.  Sometimes, services to be obtained include  permits, licenses, approvals, marketing  activities / expenses, awareness campaigns  and liasoning with the authorities for filings  and reporting requirements. • To ensure appropriate proof of service  by vendors is submitted, reviewed, and  approved before payments are released and  to ensure that the process of requisitioning,  purchasing, receiving, paying for, and  accounting for goods and services, covering  the entire process from point of order right  through to payment, is monitored, Infosys  has implemented the following controls by  reimagining system logic in procurement  systems and use of AI and ML techniques:  – Traceability of transactions at initial  procurement stages through user  declaration and OCR technology.  – Trail of documentation to substantiate  various milestones and proofs of services  availed.  – Built-in escalation matrix to ensure  timely approval of red flags identified for  appropriate resolution and action.  – Tracking of potential red flag indicators  through keyword searches and OCR  technology before raising procurement  request and payment processing.  – Periodic assessments of transactions on  sample basis considering factors such as  high-risk vendors / transactions.  – In addition, digitized self-assessment and  certification is also rolled out as part of  monitoring and controls. Anti-Bribery and   Anti-Corruption (ABAC)  practices and policy  Our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption practices  and policy is reviewed by the Management at  regular intervals.  With an evolving landscape, Infosys is  committed to a responsible Anti-Bribery &  Anti-Corruption risk management framework  to demonstrate a comprehensive risk  management program to reduce the risks by  regularly assessing risk in alignment with its  growth strategies, and to drive an ethical and  risk intelligent culture, to increase the certainty  of business outcomes. Risk assessment for bribery and corruption  risks is done periodically and the criteria  used for risk assessment include business  units / internal departments, location and the  Corruption Perception Index (CPI) index of  countries, among others. Anti-competitive practices  policy  The Anti-Trust / Anti-Competitive Practices  Policy states the objective, scope, applicability,  and regulatory consequences, and is reviewed  periodically by the Management. This policy  includes the three aspects of anti-trust law:  (i) abuse of dominance; (ii) anti-competitive  practice; (iii) merger control. Besides, a list  of do’s and don’ts are communicated to the  relevant stakeholders highlighting expected  behaviors.

The tools and technologies that we use at work have brought in a great deal of operational ease  and efficiency, making life much simpler. Often, the incentives to use these are so compelling,  that choice is only notional. On the other hand, Data Privacy (DP) regulations around the world  are demanding greater accountability from us, to ensure that these are not intrusive when  deployed.

Hence, at Infosys, the Data Privacy Office (DPO) an independent  function, ensures careful balancing before deploying them. Approach to sustained DP compliance Diagram 1: A robust framework to continuously improve data privacy  At Infosys, we constituted the data privacy  function over a decade ago as an independent  business enabling function reporting to  the management and using the globally  recognized PIMS (Privacy Information  Management System) framework. We complied  with all applicable data privacy regulations  in fiscal 2023 in building applications and  platforms, or while executing client projects,  by introducing appropriate privacy safeguards.  Our Data Privacy Policy published in the  Company intranet, demonstrates our the  Management's commitment to privacy and  applies to the entire operations including  service providers.

Towards this, it actively  participates in various initiatives with  industry forums and standard bodies globally,  contributing to developing DP frameworks,  policies and standards. The Infosys DPO is the  co-editor for ISO and IEEE standards related  to privacy engineering, management and  privacy in emerging technologies, some of  which have been published while others are  being developed. Such emerging technologies  include AI, digital twins, Metaverse and ZKP  (Zero Knowledge Proof).  Recently, AI-based tools and technologies  have proliferated across the digital industry,  bringing in rich dividends both for consumers  and businesses. However, this has also  introduced hitherto unknown privacy threats,  particularly on decisional autonomy, basic  to individual data empowerment.

These rights are legally enforceable,  but never absolute, which makes the fulfilment  complex in the current enterprise setting with  data spread across systems and servers in  multiple geographies with diverse regulatory  regimes. Infosys has established necessary  tools and processes to cater to such data  subject rights requests within the legally  stipulated timelines across Infosys locations,  including subsidiaries. Raising DP awareness through  campaigns and events  Every year, we celebrate the Data Privacy Day  by hosting engaging interventions and diverse  online interactive events like crosswords,  quizzes, chat with DPO and messages from  senior leaders to spread awareness. The events  span over several months and rewards are  offered to promote employee participation.  Additionally, monthly awareness mailers in the  form of privacy tips and scenarios reflecting  changing threats are also sent to everyone in  the organization to strengthen awareness. We  conducted International Privacy Symposium  2022, a virtual conference organized by the  Infosys Data Privacy Office in association with  IAPP and ACC, where participants included  global privacy leaders, CPOs, experts from  academia and global frontline practitioners  to reflect on key trends, challenges and best  practices. Some of the sessions organized  as part of this included privacy engineering,  anonymization, privacy-preserving synthetic  data, AI, data ethics and human behavior,  privacy standards, data subject rights and  other emerging areas. A similar symposium  is proposed to be organized in 2023 in  collaboration with international bodies.  All employees and sub-contractors have to  also mandatorily complete privacy awareness  quizzes annually, the questions and scenarios  for which are tailored based on the their  respective roles.

At Infosys, whether it is leading from the front and  being carbon neutral for the fourth consecutive year, on our journey to net zero, or driving digital  reskilling to impact 8.5 million lives, we’ve been navigating our next in terms of creating a hopeful,  progressive shared future. That we know is a responsibility. And yet, for us, ESG is so much more than responsibility. It is that powerful potential to continue to support the 2,40,000+ rural families who benefit from  our carbon offset programs. To do all we can to harness tech for good. To energize platforms to  nurture inclusion and belonging among our diverse employees, facilitate employee wellness and  experience. With 1,35,355 women making 39.4% of the workforce, we are making steady progress  toward our goal of 45% women in the organization by 2030. We launched an exclusive learning  channel for our suppliers too, this year. It drives ESG learning and best practices while providing  learners an opportunity to discuss, ideate and engage on ESG topics. It’s part of our overall effort  to build responsible supply chains. It’s the opportunity for us to amplify human potential and  create the next opportunity for people, businesses and communities. Ethisphere Institute, the global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business  practices, recognized our efforts, for the third year in a row, listing us as one of the world’s most  ethical companies. For us, however, the true reward of our efforts, continues to be the measurable impact we make on  the ecosystem - building opportunities for everyone to thrive and grow responsibly. Because, at Infosys, ESG is indeed an opportunity.

Segregation of waste  at source helps in quick disposal and has  monetary advantages like extracting energy  from the methane generated by decomposing  waste. Solid waste management operations are  typically a local responsibility, and nearly 70%  of countries have established institutions with  the responsibility for policy development and  regulatory oversight in the waste sector.  Infosys’ waste management approach is based  on the philosophy of Reduce, Reuse, Refurbish,  Repurpose and Recycle. We seek to uphold  our ambition of zero waste to landfills through  active minimization combined with technology  investment in recycling and streamlining  systems and processes. With our efforts, we  contribute to a circular economy and convert  waste into resources. Infosys has established  robust waste management practices, focusing  on waste collection, segregation and disposal  of waste.  Segregation at source Waste segregation at source refers to the  process of identifying and segregating various  types of solid wastes at the place or location  of their generation. We segregate waste  mainly into two categories - hazardous and  non-hazardous waste. Separate storage of  various components of solid waste such as  biodegradable wastes including landscape  / garden waste and food waste and non- biodegradable wastes including sanitary  waste and non-recyclable inert waste, various  categories of e-waste, and construction and  demolition wastes is practiced. A color code for  bins has been implemented for different types  of waste.  The Infosys waste management practice  involves segregation of waste at source,  secondary segregation, efficient collection  and handling, recycling, and effective disposal  of all wastes while adhering to applicable  legislations. This enables reduction of negative  environmental impacts. We also insist on eco- friendly packaging for all our purchases.

Waste generated at source gets  segregated and evaluated for reuse if possible. Waste like wood, STP sludge and bio manure slurry  from bio-methanation plants gets reused inside the campus. Construction and demolition waste  is sent to government authorized landfill sites where it further gets reused for various purposes  by the municipal corporation. Used oil from kitchens is utilized in biogas plants as it has high  codigestion COD (chemical oxygen demand) levels, which in turn generates increased biogas.

As on date, our biogas plants have a capacity  to treat 10 tons of waste a day. The bio- methanation plants/ bioreactors in Infosys  are high-rate digesters where the organic  loading rate is significantly higher even when  its loaded close to its rated capacity. Bi-phasic  bio-digestion, known for its effectiveness,  was tested at one of the Infosys sites. This  testing helped overcome challenges, such  as inconsistent input feed rate as well as the  quality of wet waste. The trial was a great  success as we were able to establish process  stabilization at all our bio-methanation plants  across India. Waste Environment   Waste recovery options Recycling Waste such as paper, plastic and metal, are  recycled, converted into other usable forms  and circulated back to the supply chain.  We have established biogas plants in our  campuses where food waste and landscape  waste is treated through bio-methanation  process, which produces biogas an alternative  to LPG in our food courts. We also have sludge  drying beds located next to our biogas plants  to dry the slurry. Soon after sun drying, dried  manure can be used for landscaping.

      "ESG REPORT 2022-23  23 Infosys | ESG REPORT 2022-23 External Document © 2023 Infosys Limited Waste Mixed waste challenge  In fiscal 2023, development centers in India had  dedicated authorized vendors to collect, sort  and dispose mixed waste to ensure minimal  waste to landfills and maximize recycling.  Co-processing achieves a superior  environmental performance as compared  to landfill and incineration which can  be demonstrated through life-cycle  assessment of waste. Co-processing  is also recognized by the UNEP Basel  Convention as a practical, cost-efficient,  safe and environmentally-preferred  option compared to other waste  treatment options. Co-processing Co-processing is the use of waste as raw  material, or as a source of energy, or both to  replace natural mineral resources and fossil  fuels. Generally, waste which cannot be reused  or recycled and has high calorific value is  selected for co-processing.  At Infosys, waste such as tetra packs, tea bags,  rubber waste, paper packaging, low value  plastic, plastic gunny bags, thermacol, foam,  carpets, discarded mop refills, lanyards, ceramic  waste, flex banners, artificial grass mats, floor  mats, glass waste, cloth waste etc., are sent for  co-processing. Environment Waste vendor evaluation  At Infosys, our green procurement policy  ensures rigorous vendor evaluation. Waste  vendors undergo a detailed vendor site audit  against several regulatory requirements.  Post this, commercial proposals are invited  and scrutinized to ensure they comply  with requirements. The proposals are then  shared with the commercial team for further  negotiations, if any. Once this process is  completed, a formal agreement is entered into  with the vendors. Vendors are audited annually  based on the waste vendor checklist.  E-waste management At Infosys, we have been persistent in our  efforts to ensure that we reduce, reuse, recycle  and dispose e-waste responsibly. Our e-waste  includes computers, desktops, laptops,  keyboards, mobiles, printers, cartridges and  batteries. Generated e-waste is always sent  back to original manufacturers (under buyback  schemes) or authorized recyclers who provide  us certificates on the successful recycling  and recovery of the material. The selection  of authorized recyclers is done keeping in  mind the extent of resource circularity in  their process. E-waste is regulated through  legislation and hence we evaluate the vendor  to ensure all compliances are addressed prior  to disposal. Environmental compliance We have a strong environmental management  system aligned with ISO 14001:2015 standards  across all India locations in line with our HSE  strategy and covers a significant portion of  the employees across the organization.  The  management system is implemented across  locations globally based on applicable legal  requirements and internal benchmarks and are  a part of our internal audit coverage.   We ensure adherence to the applicable legal  requirements across our locations. We conduct  environmental impact assessments for all our  routine and non-routine activities and the  significant concerns creating an environmental  impact include depletion of resources like  power and water, waste generation and  disposal, and emissions that are part of our  material aspects.  Environmental impacts of new services,  activities and changes in process or legislations  are also conducted. We conduct environmental  impact assessment studies for all new projects,  wherever applicable, covering impacts related  to air, water, social aspects, and biodiversity,  among others.   No cases of monetary or non-monetary  sanctions for violations or environmental  grievances have been reported in fiscal 2023.  Our campuses are built on state-approved  land in industrial areas and are not adjacent to  protected areas or biodiversity areas.  A process for monitoring requirements in  line with legal requirements is established  and we ensure that all parameters are always  maintained well within the defined norms. Waste disposal options As per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)  and State Pollution Control Board (SPCB)  guidelines, bio medical waste, oil-soaked  cotton, oil filters from DG sets, and other wastes  are disposed of through authorized agencies.  These agencies incinerate the waste as per  prescribed guidelines. The resultant ash is sent  to Treatment, Storage, Disposal Facility (TSDF)  landfills for safe disposal and in a few locations,  it is diverted for cement manufacturing. TRUE Certification-   zero waste to landfill Infosys’ India centers are heading  towards the 2030 target of zero waste to  landfills through the adoption of TRUE  Zero Waste Certification. In fiscal 2023, we embarked on a journey  to obtain TRUE Zero Waste Certification  through Green Business Certification  Inc. (GBCI) for our owned  campuses at  Bengaluru, Chennai and Pune.

Income tax The Integrated E-Filing and Central Processing  Center program takes the tax automation  journey, which started 10 year ago, to the next  level. The program not only integrates filing  and processing into a single platform, it also  brings innovation to each of the layers. In filing,  the focus was on simplification and scale. With  innovative features like tax wizard, mobile  application and pre-fill of tax forms, the new  portal makes it easier and more convenient  for taxpayers to file their income tax returns  and access related services. In processing the  entire engine was redesigned with modern  technology tools and patterns resulting in  dramatic reduction in wait time for release of  refunds (from 79 days to 7 days). Goods and Services Tax  Network (GSTN) Infosys partnered with the GSTN to  implement and manage the indirect taxation  platform for GST in India. The platform was  designed to assist taxpayers in preparing,  filing returns, making payments of indirect  tax liabilities, and maintaining additional  compliances. This unique and complex IT  project established a uniform interface for  taxpayers under indirect taxes, which was  achieved through a common and shared IT  infrastructure between the central and state  governments.

Some of our offerings that deliver employee experience are listed below: Creating employee experience  through digital transformation  We are committed to creating a world-class  experience for our employees. We believe this  will inspire employees to deliver their best  for our clients. As our employees develop a  digital future for our clients, we want them to  experience the same in their day-to-day work  at Infosys. Hence, the digitization of human  resources processes and practices becomes  a critical lever to create a great workplace  experience. Transforming the employee experience at scale  in a company of more than 3,43,000 people  spread across 56 countries is only possible  through technology. For us, digitization was  the only way forward. We are reimagining  experience using a combination of process  busting, automation and digital transformation  in people practices to create consumer-grade  digital experience for our employees. Through  digitization, we are simplifying our processes,  eliminating unnecessary approval steps  and leading straight through processing.  An example of this is InfyMe, our mobile- first, self-service platform that brings all  services to our employees’ fingertips anytime,  anywhere. InfyMe is designed to be intuitive  and contextual and aids networking and  collaboration. We continued to enrich our  InfyMe app with more services that enable  teams to operate, connect and collaborate  easily and it is particularly effective in the  hybrid work model. More than 200 touchpoints  for activities have been merged into the  intuitive interface of InfyMe. We are making our performance appraisal  process light, easy and convenient. As a first  step, we have introduced a senior management  review interface on InfyMe. Through this, we  are enabling an enhanced user experience,  faster navigation, seamless data integration  and a unified experience around development,  performance and careers. We are leveraging  the power of the Live Enterprise platform  to enable timely nudges around actions,  performance and development.    We are also focused on automation of backend,  administrative activities that can free up  HR personnel and enable them to focus on  enhancing employee experience and forming  strategic partnerships with business. An  example of this is Launchpad, our onboarding  platform, which has enabled us to digitize our  onboarding process. This mobile-based app  provides a guided flow that helps new hires  initiate their onboarding process, complete  all the necessary documentation and data  updates before their date of joining. With all  operational processes taken care of prior to  joining, employees are engaged in a more  meaningful way with managers, teams and HR  from Day 1.  In addition to the above, we are making our  systems smarter with:  • Nudges to managers and employees to  drive the right behavior on closures and  guide managers to take the right decisions  in matters like role change, retention, etc.  • Chatbots that provide instant resolutions to  queries and transactions  • Omni-channel experience for employees to  get on call support using a conversational  IVR that uses natural language voice inputs  from callers to direct them to the right  agents for support  • Self-service portals  • Robotic process automations in people  processes to reduce manual work Performance on social goals Enabling digital talent at scale Tech for good Diversity, equity and inclusion Energizing local communities Employee wellness and experience ESG is an opportunity ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE \n",

A ranking  is done based on the severity and probability  of the risk. The Occupational Health and  Safety (OH&S) hazards in the workplace are  communicated to all concerned stakeholders  who are also consulted when there are  changes in operations. Relevant OH&S hazards  are identified, and appropriate operational  controls are implemented. During training,  the hazards are shared along with directions  on ways to reduce the risk. Employees are also  consulted during development and review  of policies and procedures to manage risks.  Emergency response procedures for different  scenarios are established and mock drills are  conducted to evaluate our preparedness,  response and learnings.  Employee wellness and experience Social Occupational Health and Safety Safety and well-being at the workplace is  an important consideration in a responsible  business and Infosys accords the highest  priority to this aspect. The Health, Safety and  Environmental (HSE) Management System  at Infosys termed ‘Ozone’ is driven by the  Management commitment, legal requirements  and expectations of our stakeholders. Ozone  has not only enabled us to obtain assurance on  Management System  The robust management system has enabled  us achieve certification to ISO 45001:2018  and ISO 14001:2015 standards across all India  locations, including Infosys Limited and its  subsidiaries, in line with our HSE strategy. The  management system is implemented across  locations globally based on applicable legal  requirements and internal benchmarks and  are a part of our internal audit coverage. At  the helm of our Health, Safety, Environment  Management System (HSEMS) is our Executive  Vice President-Finance and Chief Risk  a. Risk management Ozone is based on the Demings cycle  and has a focused risk-based approach in  ensuring identification and implementation  of operational controls in line with hierarchy  and effective mitigation of hazards. Risk  assessment is proactively conducted to  identify hazards for all existing / new /  modified activities, processes, products or  services and the implementation of measures  to minimize or control impacts and monitor  them in a structured manner. Risk assessment  is proactively conducted on a yearly basis  or at the beginning of a new process or  activity. Reactive risk assessments are also  carried out at least once every quarter based  on incidents that have occurred during the  period. Hazardous conditions present are  identified and prioritized for elimination  and control. Once the identified hierarchy of  the processes instituted through certifications  but has also fostered a culture of safety and  well-being across the organization. We ensure  adherence to all applicable regulations in all  the regions we operate across the globe. We  consciously strive to ensure zero accidents,  physical and emotional well-being, and safety  of our stakeholders. Officer. The effectiveness and adequacy of  the HSE framework, its execution and HSE  performance are evaluated through periodic  management reviews. The internal-external  issues and opportunities for the organizational  context are identified. Interested parties  (including all our stakeholders), their  needs and expectations, our expectations,  legal requirements, owners and mode of  communication are also documented. Some of  the elements of the management system are  listed below: b. Incident management Incidents which include near misses / potential  hazards / accidents are reported through  internal applications, supervisors, or mails. Root  causes of incidents are identified, analyzed  and appropriate corrective actions are taken  to avoid recurrence or occurrence of incidents  leading to injuries / losses. c. Occupational Health and Safety  (OH&S) Committees OH&S Committees comprising cross-functional  teams are established at each of our campuses  and offices. The Development Center Heads  chair the safety committee meetings at their  respective locations in India. In our overseas  offices, these committees are formed based  on the local legislations. The representation  of employees in safety committees is 100%.  The committee ensures the establishment,  implementation, maintenance, and continual  improvement of processes needed for the  elimination of hazards and minimization of  risks.

Training and awareness  Embedding HSE culture in the organization  necessitates competency development.  Training needs are identified based on  the nature of jobs, which may have a  significant impact on the environment or  may pose occupational health and safety  risks. Training includes awareness building,  mock drills, classroom sessions and periodic  demonstrations. HSEMS training is also a part  of our employee induction program. To enable  continuous learning, a HSE awareness module  is available on Lex, our internal learning  platform. Job-specific and generic trainings  are conducted for contractual staff during  induction and later through refresher training.  e. Health and safety interventions  We have always focused on building a culture  of safety at Infosys. Individual responsibility  for safety is always emphasized. Safety in the  workplace is one of the highest priorities.  Systems have been established to ensure the  same, including work permits, trainings, Lock  out, Tag out (LOTO), safety inspections, audits,  operational controls and monitoring. Policies  and processes, which cover various aspects of  safety, have been established. These include  women’s safety, lone working, transport,  travel and construction, among others. Gaps,  learnings, deviations and findings, if any, are  identified, controls implemented and tracked  for effective closure. As Infosys is an IT / ITES  company, there are no product risks but there  are risks including those related to provision of  services like ergonomics, emotional well-being,  risks associated with operation of utilities,  commute. We have established numerous  initiatives, interventions, virtual sessions, and  process controls to address them. Awareness  sessions are conducted for ergonomics across  locations. Workstations and furniture are  designed and procured after considering their  ergonomic advantages. We have also taken  care to procure systems which have inbuilt  features that help avoid glare and hence  reduce such instances. Sessions on ergonomics  help address work-related conditions such as  myalgia. Ergonomic incidents reported are  treated and exercise regimens suggested.  During fiscal 2023, 39 occupational ergonomics  issues were reported. Various interventions on physical and  emotional well-being were enabled under  the aegis of our HALE / SAFE initiatives during  the year. Well-equipped occupational health  centers / physiotherapy facilities are available  on our campuses in India. The telemedicine  portal through which employees can consult  our occupational health center doctors online  was operational in India during the year.  Behavior-Based Safety (BBS) programs include  BBS observation for contract staff, periodic  inspections, trainings, observations from mock  drills and employee engagement programs.  f. Participation and consultation  The process includes:  • Employee consultation in development  and review of policies and procedures to  manage risks  • Consultation where there are any changes  that affect workplace health and safety;  a management of change procedure is in  place to address health and safety issues  before a change occurs  • Representation of employees in health  and safety matters; the Safety Committee  includes employee and contract workmen  representatives  • The OH&S hazards in the workplace are  communicated to all concerned including  contractors and visitors. They are also  consulted when there are changes in  operations and the relevant OH&S hazards  are identified, appropriate operational  controls implemented and the same is  communicated to all concerned • Health promotion programs are conducted  to encourage employee involvement in  health and safety. A Safety Week and Health  Week are conducted annually. • Employees, including contract workmen,  are entrusted with the responsibility of  participation in the ongoing HSE activities.  Employees are encouraged to participate  in the process of reviewing risks in their  respective areas of operations from time to  time, and developing and sharing strategies  to eliminate, mitigate or reduce those risks.  • Employees are required to report all  incidents to the HSE team to establish  and implement operational controls to  avoid the recurrence of the incidents and  aid in elimination of unsafe behavior and  conditions. • The expectation from employees is to  participate in the emergency mock drills  and report or identify learnings which need  to be addressed.

The sense  of connectedness measured at 91% because  of the ability of different teams to collaborate  and connect with each other emotionally.  HALE successfully touched the lives of 1,50,000  employees through 431 initiatives, where we  witnessed a three-fold increase in employee  participation. The key focus for us was mental  health. We conducted 150 interventions on  mental health-related topic this year.  Hybrid well-being The hybrid work model urged us to consider a  hybrid well-being awareness and engagement  approach. We created a page on hybrid  well-being on our HALE portal and launched  a hybrid wellness toolkit for employees and  managers, and a Hello Hybrid widget which  provided HALE counsellor contacts. Initiatives  across development centers such as habit- forming campaigns, Bring Your Kids to Work  days and story-sharing forums strengthened  awareness and engagement among  employees.  Employee satisfaction  Infosys has robust mechanisms to gauge  employee sentiments and feedback. Up  until fiscal 2020, employee engagement at  Infosys was measured through the annual  LITMUS survey. When the pandemic struck,  the team quickly reimagined this tool for  the new remote way of work and introduced  a periodic feedback mechanism called  Pulse. Pulse collects ongoing and real-time  feedback from employees anonymously on  key organization-wide themes that shape  an employee’s experience at Infosys such as  work, learning and careers. We poll the entire  organization through a micro survey every  month. In addition to this, we also poll our  employees on select tenure-based milestones  and specific events including onboarding,  job rotation and appraisals. This cumulative  understanding of employee perception, and  feedback from actual events and milestones  have strengthened our sensing architecture  to obtain richer insights of employee  experiences. To drive change across the  Employee satisfaction FY2021 FY2022 73% 75% FY2023 82% Performance management  Infosys has established a high-performance  culture and our employee breathe this each  day. Our performance management process  drives a 'meritocracy culture' yet stays  individual employee focused and development  oriented. We focus on identifying the best  performers against standards of performance  instead of relative comparison of individuals.  This mechanism helps us to identify our best  performers through well-defined goals that  are always relevant, continuous feedback and  a strong focus on employee development.  Aligning with this performance management  philosophy, we have the defined performance  review and assessment process.  Continuous feedback is an essential  element of the process with regular reviews,  culminating into a rating based holistic view  of the employee’s performance. Performance  conversations between employee and manager  happens on an ongoing basis, given the  continuous performance process that we have  in Infosys. The continuous feedback process  organization, all managers have access to a  real-time customized dashboard with feedback  from their respective teams, which enable  them to engage with their teams better and  address any concerns. This dashboard has  multiple views and advanced analytics such  as heatmaps, trendlines, sentiment analytics  to enable the managers to prioritize focus  areas according to their teams. Managers  along with their respective units HR executives  and leadership work on making changes or  improvements at the Unit / team level on the  ground. Over 50,000 employees participated  in Q4 with insights gathered around various  themes of the organization. These insights  have led us to create focus areas for actionizing  on a quarterly basis which is socialized with the  leadership team.

Thus, iCount goes a long way in providing  a holistic view of the employees performance.  Resolution hubs  A safe and positive work environment is what  we want to be associated with. In keeping with  this philosophy, we envisage an open-door  policy. Employees can access several forums  where they can highlight matters or concerns  faced at the workplace. This is achieved  through a well-established and robust  grievance resolution mechanism comprising  ‘resolution hubs’. The Anti-Sexual Harassment  Initiative (ASHI) and the Hearing Employees  and Resolving (HEAR) forums are designated  as redressal forums for sexual harassment and  workplace related complaints, respectively.  Resolution hubs adhere to the principles of  natural justice, ensure confidentiality, and  non-retaliation while addressing concerns. The  concerns are handled with utmost sensitivity  and are redressed and closed in a timebound  manner. A detailed investigation process  ensures fairness and provides an opportunity  to present facts and any material evidence  pertaining to the grievance.  Read more on Infosys resolution hub  Human rights  Infosys is a signatory to the UNGC. Our  human rights stand is contained in our Code  of Conduct and Ethics in an important tenet,  ‘Respecting Each Other.’ The Infosys Human  Rights Statement articulates our philosophy to  provide a discrimination-free workplace for all  employees and contractors. All our employees  and contractors undergo a mandatory Smart  Awareness Quiz (SAQ), every year, which  includes questions on human rights and the  Infosys Code of Conduct and Ethics. The SAQ is  a comprehensive tool which also includes ‘self- study’ tutorials, allowing employees to learn  and then take up the assessments.  In fiscal 2023, we conducted an independent  Human Rights Impact Assessment of our  operations across India. India comprises >80%  of our employee base. The assessment protocol  was created based on the Articles contained  in the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights (UDHR), ILO, UNGC Principles, the GRI  Standards, the Business Responsibility and  Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) parameters,  as well as Health and Safety criteria and  environment management systems.   It is our constant endeavor to make Infosys a  place where people can be the best version  of themselves. The Talent Pulse Report 2022,  provides a glimpse into our Employee wellness  and experience practices. Employee wellness  and experience is an important ambition  as a part of Infosys’ ESG Vision 2030. The  suggestions from the independent human  rights impact assessment allowed us to  accelerate our part time and remote work  policies and inform our hybrid model further.  The minimum notice period for significant  operational changes are included in the  collective bargaining agreements (CBA)  wherever mandated by law. In countries  where there is no such mandate to include  them in the CBA or in countries where CBA  is not mandated, we abide by the local laws  prevailing in the land. In all other scenarios,  Infosys prescribes the notice period based on  the type of change. All our security personnel are trained on  human rights related topics. The Infosys  Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) has reference  to human rights and it states, ‘Infosys expects  its suppliers to support and respect the  protection of internationally proclaimed  human rights and to ensure that they are not  complicit in human rights abuses.’ As part  of the onboarding process the vendors  have to accept the SCoC. The procurement  team ensures that SCoC acceptance is done  by vendors and maintains a tracker for the  same. In fiscal 2022, we committed to an  independent responsible supplier assessment  for our top 100 suppliers over the next 4 years.  As on fiscal 2023, 46 supplier ESG assessments  have been completed.  Read more. helps managers provide instant feedback for  necessary improvements in the work that is  being done.  Infosys performance management puts  equal focus on the future development of the  employee and the introduction of Individual  Development Plan (IDP) is a testament to the  same. IDPs are created by employees under  the guidance of the manager and are a perfect  blend of theory and application. Managers  coach and mentor the employee to set career  and professional aspirations and reach them  in a structured manner. Employees are also  encouraged to take up training to upskill /  reskill themselves to meet the needs of the  projects.  In case of continued lack of expected  performance, employees are identified for a  structured performance improvement plan  where they are given goals and the managers  support them in achieving these goals.  At the end of the performance cycle employees  receive a performance rating. To support the  process, we have our web and mobile app  called iCount, where employees can add their  goals and are encouraged to update progress  against the same on a regular basis. Managers  can provide feedback to employees on these  goals and support them in achieving the  objectives. Feedback from client stakeholder  (although not mandated by the process) is  also a key input that the manager uses during  performance and development conversations.

As a signatory to the  United Nations Global Compact, Infosys leverages the UNGC principles covering human rights,  labor, environment, and anti-corruption as foundational principles for building and improving  its sustainable supply chain practices. The Company’s Responsible Supply Chain and Supplier  Diversity Policy is an expression of our commitment to integrate these principles into our  supply chain relationships and towards building long-term environmental, social, and economic  opportunities for diverse businesses. This commitment is manifested in our internal activities and  processes, as well as through the organizations we engage with externally. Integrity and ethics  govern all our supplier partnerships, while also supporting and encouraging the aspirations of  diverse businesses.  Infosys Supplier Code of  Conduct  Infosys prides itself in the way it conducts  its business and has always been a company  with a strong commitment to ethical business  practices and sustainability. Infosys encourages  its suppliers to join in this commitment, based  on a shared set of values and principles. Infosys  pursues mutually beneficial relationships with  its Suppliers and seeks to work with businesses  that are committed to act fairly and with  integrity towards their stakeholders, observing  the applicable rules of law. The Supplier Code  of Conduct (SCoC) draws inspiration from the  Infosys Code of Conduct and Ethics and the  principles of the UNGC. It provides a detailed  account of material topics that we are focused  on to nurture and sustain responsible supply  chains.  Building sustainable and responsible supply chains Corporate governance Governance Diligence before empanelment  As part of the pre-contract and evaluation,  we perform exhaustive due diligence of  suppliers in sanctions, corruption, financial  crimes, litigations and ESG issues at the time of  onboarding and periodically thereafter, with  the help of a third-party tool. This assessment  covers compliance, adverse media, information  security, physical security and sustainability,  based on the type of vendor. We have  onboarded 1946 new suppliers in fiscal 2023.  Additionally, we have incorporated ESG criteria  into the supplier onboarding process. 45% of  our new suppliers were screened using the  third party tool.

The  portal contains ESG learning and best practices  and provides learners an opportunity to  discuss, ideate and engage on ESG topics. Corporate governance Governance ESG assessments  In 2021, we made a commitment to assess  100 of our top suppliers (by spend) on ESG  over a four-year period. As on fiscal 2023,  we have covered 46 suppliers through  this assessment. The assessments covered  governance, ethics and compliance with  law, fair business practices, labor practices  and human rights, health and safety, and  environment. The assessment is based on a  protocol which leverages the Infosys Supplier  Code of Conduct (SCoC), ISO 26000, GRI,  UNHRC, Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) and  other international frameworks. The Infosys  Supplier Code of Conduct leverages the UNGC  principles including protecting and upholding  internationally proclaimed human rights,  endorsing treating all persons with respect  and dignity while safeguarding their rights, the  elimination of forced and compulsory labor,  the abolition of child labor in the supply chain  and strong corporate governance practices  including anti-corruption and anti-bribery and  promoting fair business practices across the  supply chain. As an environmentally conscious  organization, Infosys also urges suppliers to  protect the environment and make abstemious  use of scarce natural resources in their  business processes. As part of the onboarding  process, all vendors have to accept the Infosys  SCoC, and this is ensured and tracked by the  procurement team.  46%  of top 100 suppliers  underwent ESG assessments  in the last two years No. of MSME  suppliers  24,891 contract staff  engaged 777 Our centralized procurements are in India,  but we engage with local suppliers for local  needs across geographies.

Integrity is key to nurturing a responsible business. Beyond regulation and stakeholder  attention, there is a growing recognition that good behavior is good for business. At Infosys, our  commitment to a value-based ethos is enshrined in our Code of Conduct and Ethics. Our values are the principles we use to run the Company daily and are the source of our Code of  Conduct and Ethics. Our values are the foundation of everything we do and are encapsulated in  the acronym C-LIFE (Client value; Leadership by example; Integrity and transparency; Fairness and  Excellence). Reinforcing a culture of  compliance  1. Code of Conduct and Ethics (Digital  version): We also have a digital version of  the Code of Conduct and Ethics. It provides  user-friendly access to specific topics  in an interactive manner. It is a unique  audio-visual experience and is easy to  navigate. The Code can be accessed on  mobile devices as well.

The digital version  of the Code is available here. 2. Code of Conduct and Ethics training:  Our employees and Board members  are trained on the Code of Conduct and  Ethics. We have a Smart Awareness Quiz  (SAQ) which includes training modules  that employees are mandatorily required  to undertake every year to renew their  commitment to the Code of Conduct and  Ethics. Our vendor partners were also  trained on the Supplier Code of Conduct  through various channels including  live sessions during the vendor partner  meet called Sambandh. We also have  a detailed communication plan to use  multiple channels of communication like  emails, video messages, blogs, gamified  assessments, and storyboards to spread  awareness about various policies. 3. #SwipeRightforIntegrity:  #SwipeRightforIntegrity is an annual  legal and compliance event organized  by Infosys. The event brings our leaders  together to reinforce our values of integrity,  Integrity and compliance  transparency and good governance to  build enduring relationships with our  clients, employees and partners. It has  become a platform to create awareness  and have an engaging dialogue with all  stakeholders, and influence behavior and  showcase the Infosys culture. This has  taken forward the compliance and ethics  program and created increased awareness  of expected behavior. 4. Local Compliance Officer program:   To further raise awareness among our  employees about ethical aspects globally, a  local compliance officer (LCO) network has  also been created across the Infosys Group  in collaboration with Office of Integrity  and Compliance. The LCO network plays a  crucial role, in promoting an organizational  culture that encourages ethical conduct  and a commitment to compliance with the  law, regulations, and policies and helps in  maximizing the impact of ethics-related  communication and training. Corporate governance Governance Code of Conduct and Ethics  We firmly believe that following the highest  standards of business conduct and ethics helps  us run our business responsibly.

The export  control program protects the company and  its employees from potential risk of violation  of sanctions prescribed under export control  regulations and facilitates business expansion  in accordance with these regulations. All our  customers and vendors are screened against  various sanctions to ensure that we are  compliant. As part of the program, training  modules are rolled out to relevant employees  to ensure that they are aware and are  compliant with export control laws.  We have a self-assessment and certification  program in place for anti-bribery and anti- corruption, anti-trust / anti-competition, and  export control.  Whistleblower Policy The Infosys Whistleblower Policy, last amended  in January 2022, is a comprehensive and  well-designed mechanism that encourages  employees, vendors, customers, and any other  stakeholders to report any unethical conduct,  violation of applicable laws or the Company’s  Code of Conduct and Ethics occurring within  the Company. With strict confidentiality  measures and multiple reporting channels,  the policy ensures that whistleblowers are  protected from any retaliation. The company  reviews all complaints impartially and takes  appropriate action, as applicable, while  providing regular communication to ensure  awareness about the policy. The Infosys  Whistleblower Policy is a testament to the  Company’s commitment to transparency,  accountability, and responsible corporate  citizenship. Corporate governance Governance Use of technology for effective  compliance monitoring of  controls We have leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI)  and Machine Learning (ML) technology to  review and identify exceptions in compliance  and ABAC controls. Compliance proof-testing • Infosys implemented a compliance program  covering 80 countries and 14 regulatory  areas across major business enabling  functions in September 2018. • The program instituted a self-assessment of  the compliance status against a compliance  framework with a maker checker process  built into it. • The program also enabled the creation of  a repository of compliance proofs against  self-assessment. • By consolidating compliance proofs across  countries and regulatory areas, Infosys  designed an OCR-based technology to  scan the proofs and validate if the proofs  corroborate the compliance status. • The OCR technology was combined with  a rule engine to test compliance controls  around timeliness and accuracy of the  compliance proof. ABAC program • Infosys develops and manages multiple  office facilities and collaborates with  multiple vendors / service providers during  the various phases of construction. Infosys  engages with vendors for infrastructure  development and facility maintenance.  Sometimes, services to be obtained include  permits, licenses, approvals, marketing  activities / expenses, awareness campaigns  and liasoning with the authorities for filings  and reporting requirements. • To ensure appropriate proof of service  by vendors is submitted, reviewed, and  approved before payments are released and  to ensure that the process of requisitioning,  purchasing, receiving, paying for, and  accounting for goods and services, covering  the entire process from point of order right  through to payment, is monitored, Infosys  has implemented the following controls by  reimagining system logic in procurement  systems and use of AI and ML techniques:  – Traceability of transactions at initial  procurement stages through user  declaration and OCR technology.  – Trail of documentation to substantiate  various milestones and proofs of services  availed.  – Built-in escalation matrix to ensure  timely approval of red flags identified for  appropriate resolution and action.  – Tracking of potential red flag indicators  through keyword searches and OCR  technology before raising procurement  request and payment processing.  – Periodic assessments of transactions on  sample basis considering factors such as  high-risk vendors / transactions.  – In addition, digitized self-assessment and  certification is also rolled out as part of  monitoring and controls. Anti-Bribery and   Anti-Corruption (ABAC)  practices and policy  Our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption practices  and policy is reviewed by the Management at  regular intervals.  With an evolving landscape, Infosys is  committed to a responsible Anti-Bribery &  Anti-Corruption risk management framework  to demonstrate a comprehensive risk  management program to reduce the risks by  regularly assessing risk in alignment with its  growth strategies, and to drive an ethical and  risk intelligent culture, to increase the certainty  of business outcomes. Risk assessment for bribery and corruption  risks is done periodically and the criteria  used for risk assessment include business  units / internal departments, location and the  Corruption Perception Index (CPI) index of  countries, among others. Anti-competitive practices  policy  The Anti-Trust / Anti-Competitive Practices  Policy states the objective, scope, applicability,  and regulatory consequences, and is reviewed  periodically by the Management. This policy  includes the three aspects of anti-trust law:  (i) abuse of dominance; (ii) anti-competitive  practice; (iii) merger control. Besides, a list  of do’s and don’ts are communicated to the  relevant stakeholders highlighting expected  behaviors.

On the other hand, Data Privacy (DP) regulations around the world  are demanding greater accountability from us, to ensure that these are not intrusive when  deployed. Many of these tools, platforms and processes have the propensity to breach privacy if  not deployed with due diligence. Hence, at Infosys, the Data Privacy Office (DPO) an independent  function, ensures careful balancing before deploying them. Approach to sustained DP compliance Diagram 1: A robust framework to continuously improve data privacy  At Infosys, we constituted the data privacy  function over a decade ago as an independent  business enabling function reporting to  the management and using the globally  recognized PIMS (Privacy Information  Management System) framework. We complied  with all applicable data privacy regulations  in fiscal 2023 in building applications and  platforms, or while executing client projects,  by introducing appropriate privacy safeguards.  Our Data Privacy Policy published in the  Company intranet, demonstrates our the  Management's commitment to privacy and  applies to the entire operations including  service providers. To ensure complete  transparency, we provide privacy notices at  Governance the time of data collection to both internal  and external data subjects and the privacy  statement for external data subjects is also  made available in the public domain. These  are constantly updated to reflect the changes  in personal data processing or applicable DP  regulations.  Privacy Statement Infosys does not do behavioral advertising.  Infosys also does not use personal data for  secondary purposes. Whenever there is a  change in the purpose, data subjects are  notified of the new purpose through privacy  notices.

Quarterly senior management reviews  ensure adequate oversight. Aspirations in DP  We make every effort to protect the personal  information that comes under our purview.  Our data privacy compliance framework is  based on ISO 27701 with inputs that include  convergence of international best practices,  client-prescribed requirements and applicable  data privacy regulations across geographies.  Adopting internationally  accepted protocols  We are among the first few organizations  globally, to have our framework certified  with accreditation, for ISO 27701 privacy  information management standard. We intend  to increase the coverage of the certification  across the enterprise in phases.  Privacy by Design (PbD)   EPIC program Anticipating the need to make privacy an  integral part of any process or application  dealing with personal data, an organization- wide strategic initiative named EPIC  (Embedding Privacy by design into Infosys  Culture) was rolled out in early 2022 by  the DPO in collaboration with Quality and  Delivery functions. EPIC embeds PbD into the  solution development process at Infosys to  enable responsible data-centric innovation  Data privacy Governance that complies with DP regulations, leading to  market differentiation. The program focuses  on introducing PbD strategies, patterns and  guidelines to integrate privacy principles and  requirements into solutions and platforms  development. To institutionalize privacy by  design, a two-phased enabling program is  under way. In phase one, foundational and  intermediate courses on privacy by design  were designed and enabled for all employees  globally. Phase two is focusing on taking the  privacy by design implementation to clients.  Vendor DP guidelines  Vendor DP management of our extended  entities has assumed strategic significance  in the current scenario of third-party risks,  given the increasing volume of data breaches,  and enterprise dependency on outsourcing  including cloud service providers. Suppliers  present difficult and unique privacy and  cyber security challenges. Compliance with  diverse data protection laws across the world  requires an effective mechanism for managing  supplier-related risks to Infosys. We have  published comprehensive guidelines for  suppliers / vendors to ensure that they adhere  to strict obligations imposed by contracts  and applicable laws of the land, during their  engagement with Infosys and its subsidiaries.  The Infosys Supplier Code of Conduct is  mandated across all essential suppliers  involved in processing of personal data, along  with necessary data processing clauses which  are agreed prior to their onboarding. Assurance  is further demonstrated through due diligence  and annual assessments.  Robust incident management  and breach handling  At Infosys, we have robust mechanisms to  detect, assess, contain and manage data  privacy breaches and incidents with well- defined processes and procedures to respond  to breach notifications within defined timelines  in accordance with the laws of the land.

      "ESG REPORT 2022-23  62 Infosys | ESG REPORT 2022-23 External Document © 2023 Infosys Limited Driving DP thought leadership  In this constantly changing privacy threat  landscape, the Infosys DPO recognizes the  need for regular engagement with industry  and government bodies to shape the future  of data privacy. Towards this, it actively  participates in various initiatives with  industry forums and standard bodies globally,  contributing to developing DP frameworks,  policies and standards. The Infosys DPO is the  co-editor for ISO and IEEE standards related  to privacy engineering, management and  privacy in emerging technologies, some of  which have been published while others are  being developed. Such emerging technologies  include AI, digital twins, Metaverse and ZKP  (Zero Knowledge Proof).  Recently, AI-based tools and technologies  have proliferated across the digital industry,  bringing in rich dividends both for consumers  and businesses. However, this has also  introduced hitherto unknown privacy threats,  particularly on decisional autonomy, basic  to individual data empowerment. At Infosys,  data privacy and data ethics are an integral  parts of the responsible AI framework and all  AI-based solutions and platforms are subjected  to privacy assessments before deployment,  to balance business value derived with data  privacy. Data privacy Governance high impact, and / or if the law of the land  mandates, such breaches are notified to the  impacted data subjects and /or supervisory  authority. We also incorporate key learnings  from incidents in privacy awareness stories  and tips sent to employees. Incidents of high  and critical nature are reported to the incident  disclosure committee, consisting of senior  leaders including the CEO & MD. Infosys has  zero tolerance for any breaches, which in  addition to appropriate preventive measures,  are controlled through effective deterrent  mechanisms including stringent consequence  management.  In fiscal 2023, there were no substantiated  complaints received concerning breaches of  customer privacy from outside parties and  regulatory authorities. Data subject rights  management  Data subject rights, which have become an  intrinsic part of data privacy laws in many  countries, are legal rights enjoyed by the data  subject. These rights are legally enforceable,  but never absolute, which makes the fulfilment  complex in the current enterprise setting with  data spread across systems and servers in  multiple geographies with diverse regulatory  regimes. Infosys has established necessary  tools and processes to cater to such data  subject rights requests within the legally  stipulated timelines across Infosys locations,  including subsidiaries. Raising DP awareness through  campaigns and events  Every year, we celebrate the Data Privacy Day  by hosting engaging interventions and diverse  online interactive events like crosswords,  quizzes, chat with DPO and messages from  senior leaders to spread awareness. The events  span over several months and rewards are  offered to promote employee participation.  Additionally, monthly awareness mailers in the  form of privacy tips and scenarios reflecting  changing threats are also sent to everyone in  the organization to strengthen awareness. We  conducted International Privacy Symposium  2022, a virtual conference organized by the  Infosys Data Privacy Office in association with  IAPP and ACC, where participants included  global privacy leaders, CPOs, experts from  academia and global frontline practitioners  to reflect on key trends, challenges and best  practices. Some of the sessions organized  as part of this included privacy engineering,  anonymization, privacy-preserving synthetic  data, AI, data ethics and human behavior,  privacy standards, data subject rights and  other emerging areas. A similar symposium  is proposed to be organized in 2023 in  collaboration with international bodies.  All employees and sub-contractors have to  also mandatorily complete privacy awareness  quizzes annually, the questions and scenarios  for which are tailored based on the their  respective roles.
